    Args:
        log_probs (torch.FloatTensor): Input tensor with shape (N, T, U, V)
            where N is the minibatch size, T is the maximum number of
            input frames, U is the maximum number of output labels and V is
            the vocabulary of labels (including the blank).
        labels (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N, U-1) representing the
            reference labels for all samples in the minibatch.
        frames_lengths (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N,) representing the
            number of frames for each sample in the minibatch.
        labels_lengths (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N,) representing the
            length of the transcription for each sample in the minibatch.
        average_frames (bool, optional): Specifies whether the loss of each
            sample should be divided by its number of frames.
            Default: False.
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the type of reduction.
            Default: None.
        blank (int, optional): label used to represent the blank symbol.
            Default: 0.
        gather (bool, optional): Reduce memory consumption.
            Default: False.
        fastemit_lambda (float, optional): FastEmit regularization
            (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11148).
            Default: 0.0.
